Thank you for showing interest in NJCâ€™s flagship Internship program and you have been shortlisted for the next round of selection process.  Next round is quite simple, all you need to do is create a database, store your interesting movie names with the names of lead actor, actress, year of release and the director name. Once you have stored the details, then use any programming language of your choice to retrieve the details.
